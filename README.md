# Function Approximation

An example of how to use orthogonal projection to speed up some mathematical CUDA kernels.

## Introduction

Some CUDA kernels perform heavy scientific computing tasks, this sample project shows how to find alternative functions and speed up the kernel.

Checkout [this article](http://shuyangsun.com/portfolio/orthogonal-projection-and-parallel-computing.htm) I wrote for a detailed explanation of the math and implementation behind it.
